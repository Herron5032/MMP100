  <h1>Biography</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the fan site for the 30 under 30 DJ Marshmello. This website will include his Biography, most recent articles and a tribute made by me using Adobe PhotoShop.</p>
<p>Chris Comstock, better known by his stage name Marshmello, was born on May 19, 1992. He is an American electronic dance music producer and DJ. He first gained international recognition by remixing songs by Jack Ãœ and Zedd, and later collaborated with artists including Omar LinX, Ookay, Jauz and Slushii. In January 2017, his song "Alone" appeared on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. </p>
<p>Marshmello's stage name, an alternative spelling of "marshmallow", and his marshmallow mascot head were both inspired by Canadian electro house music producer and DJ deadmau5, who also notably uses an alternate spelling for his stage name and performs wearing a "dead mouse" mascot head. Acknowledgement of deadmau5's contribution to Marshmello's persona is evident in the music video for "Alone", which features Marshmello's pet mouse, Joel (deadmau5's real name). Marshmellow also referenced deadmau5 with a variant of his helmet (with a third ear) featured in the original edit of "Ritual"'s music video. This was removed at deadmau5's request.</p>
<p>Marshmello is one the many DJs that has helped me realize my dream for electronic music making. Before i saw him and Jauz at Ezoo, i was hesitant about making music. After seeing them i realized "this is my dream", i cant hold back anymore. SO i thank them for showing me how much fun music making can be.</p>
