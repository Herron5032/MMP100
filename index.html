   <h1>HELLO I AM OWEIN!</h1>
    <p> Owein Ramirez is a full-time student at Borough of Manhattan Community College, studying Liberal Arts. He is planning on transferring to Fordham University to study Economics, after he gets his bachelors Owein plans on attending Law School, hopefully at Columbia University but he does have other options in line. Owein enjoys spending time with family and friends. He is also an animal guy and enjoys the company of animals, his favorite animal is the wolf and hopes to one day adopt one. His favorite things to do are make music, play video games, and watch episodes of his favorite shows. Owein took up the hobby of being a DJ at 16 because he loved music so much he wanted to have fun with music and not just listen to it. He has been a DJ for 2-3 years, his first years consisted of learning and perfecting his mixing. He does have many projects done and will have many more to come. As of the year 2017, Owein has decided to become a Music Producer/Beat Maker, because it will allow him to explore another aspect of music and teach him more than what DJing could. One day Owein plans to perform at venues like EDC, Electric Zoo, Tomorrow land, etc. He has a fun/smart/bright future ahead of him. Enjoy his latest mix:</p>
